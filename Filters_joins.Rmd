```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r Libraries}

```{r Data}
fish<-read_csv(here("data","fish.csv"))
kelp_abur<-read_excel(here("data","kelp.xlsx"), sheet="abur")

```

```{r Filtering}
fish_garibaldi <- fish %>% filter(common_name == "garibaldi")

##The == tells R to find only exact matches in the row of common_name and then these are used to form the new table based on the characters given

fish_over50 <- fish %>% filter(total_count >= 50)

##The exclusion can be based on numeric columns too if you give R instructions to exclude using equals and greater than or less to signs
```

```{r Or/And}
fish_3sp <- fish %>% filter(common_name == "garibaldi" | common_name == "blacksmith" |  common_name == "black surfperch")

##The vertical line notates an Or statement to R so any fish with this name in the common_name column will appear on this table

aque_2018 <- fish %>% filter(year == 2018, site == "aque")

##A comma or an & between the two specifications will read into R as an and statement which requires both criteria to be met to be included
```

```{r Partial Strings}
fish_bl <- fish %>% filter(str_detect(common_name, pattern = "black"))

##Fish with a common name containing the word black are put into this graph using the filter()+str_detect() functions combined 

##We can also exclude observations that contain a set string pattern by adding the negate = TRUE argument within str_detect()
